TO DO:

1. Create a loop to load 2017 to 2020 (later 2023).
2. Append years to Tabulator asynchronously.
3. Display a timeline that auto-updates as Tabulator changes.

Note: We will soon be addig a dash in the annual file names between US and the 2-char state.
USAK-census-naics6-2020.csv will become US-AK-census-naics6-2020.csv
