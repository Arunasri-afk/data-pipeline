TO DO - Within javascript in the current page:

1. Loop through years 2017 to 2020. - Person 1
2. Append each year to an array of year rows called yearRecords. - Person 1
3. Append each year to Tabulator asynchronously as 4 year files load. - Person 1
4. Display an Observable Framework timeline that auto-updates as Tabulator changes. - Person 2
5. Merge names of industries in javascript using our [NAICS Lookup](https://model.earth/community-data/us/id_lists/industry_id_list.csv) - Person 3

If you're Person 2 or 3, work in a copy of the index.html page. Deploy within this folder in your fork.

Note: We will soon be addig a dash in the annual file names between US and the 2-char state.
