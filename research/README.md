# Using Machine Learning for Census Business Data Gaps

#### By Loren K. Heyns, John A. Taylor, Benjamin Liu

## Using Machine Learning to Fill Gaps

When a county's 6-digit industry naics is missing employee and payroll data, its parent categories (5, 4, 3 or 2-digit naics) will also omit the data. This occurs when there are only a couple firms in a county to protect the privacy of individual firms. (We've seen 15+ establishments with no data.)

A very rough estimate for local industry employee counts and payroll can be generated by averaging values from other counties in the state, however some states have over 80 of 380+ industries without any employee and payroll data.

We'll be comparing results from our [Machine Learning scripts](https://github.com/modelearth/machine-learning) to the [Eckert CBP data](https://github.com/modelearth/cbp_database_public) generated by linear objective functions.

## NAICS Data without Gaps

[Imputed County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset](http://www.fpeckert.me/cbp/) by [Fabian Eckert, et al.](http://fpeckert.me/cbp/efsy.pdf) - The Fabian Eckert (2021) work extends Isserman and Westervelt (2006), but uses a linear objective function for faster computation with exact results. The authors are planning to apply to zip codes. "After 1994, the CBP files contain tabulations at the zip code level. We plan to apply our imputation method to this geographic unit in a future draft." - [2018 data from Eckert](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/cbp) and our [GitHub Fork](https://github.com/modelearth/cbp_database_public).
