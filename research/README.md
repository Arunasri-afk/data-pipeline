## Using Machine Learning to Fill Gaps

When a county's 6-digit industry naics is missing employee and payroll data, its parent categories (5, 4, 3 or 2-digit naics) will also omit the data. This occurs when there are only a couple firms in a county to protect the privacy of individual firms. (Sometimes when there are over 15 establishments in a county, the employment data is also null.)

A very rough estimate for local industry employee counts and payroll can be generated by averaging values from other counties in the state, however in some states over 80 of 380+ industries do not include employment and payroll data.

We'll be comparing results from our [Machine Learning scripts](https://github.com/modelearth/machine-learning) to the [Eckert CBP data](https://github.com/modelearth/cbp_database_public) generated by linear objective functions.

## 2017 NAICS Data without Gaps

As of 2017, the US Census inserts estimates (perturbs cells) for small employment counts. Therefore, [fpeckert](http://www.fpeckert.me/cbp/) does not impute data from 2017 forward since there are no missing cells in the data.

[Imputed County Business Patterns (CBP) dataset](http://www.fpeckert.me/cbp/) by [Fabian Eckert, et al.](http://fpeckert.me/cbp/efsy.pdf) - The Fabian Eckert (2021) work extends Isserman and Westervelt (2006), but uses a linear objective function for faster computation with exact results. The authors are planning to apply to zip codes. "After 1994, the CBP files contain tabulations at the zip code level. We plan to apply our imputation method to this geographic unit in a future draft." - GitHub Fork: [cbp\_database\_public](https://github.com/modelearth/cbp_database_public) and 2018 output: [efsy_panel_naics_2018.csv](https://github.com/modelearth/community-data/tree/master/process/naics/source) - number of employees but not firms.
